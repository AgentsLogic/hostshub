// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// I will add a comment indicating that these variables are likely part of a testing framework
// and should be available in the test environment.  If they are intended to be used
// within the component itself, further context would be needed to determine their purpose
// and appropriate initialization.

// Assuming 'it', 'is', 'correct', 'and', and 'brevity' are part of a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha)
// and are available in the test environment.  If they are intended to be used within the component,
// further context is needed to determine their purpose and appropriate initialization.

// Example:
// describe('Rates Page', () => {
//   it('should render without errors', () => {
//     // ... assertions using 'is', 'correct', 'and', 'brevity'
//   });
// });

// If the variables are not part of a testing framework, they need to be declared and initialized.
// For example:
// const brevity = "";
// const it = () => {};
// const is = () => {};
// const correct = () => {};
// const and = () => {};

// The rest of the original code would follow here.  Since the original code was omitted,
// I cannot provide a complete merged file.  This response addresses the specific issue
// of the undeclared variables based on the information provided.
